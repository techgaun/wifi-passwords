# wifi-passwords
Collection of wifi passwords of various eateries, restaurants, etc. [mostly in Kathmandu]

### Why

I roam around the city and work from various restaurants mostly in Kathmandu and take various devices. Thought it would be useful for people who search for wifi passwords (its fairly common to comment wifi passwords in services like Foursquare but not in the context of Nepal). Note that the information can change a lot and would appreciate a pull request if you know the latest information.
